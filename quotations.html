	    	<h2 style="border: 5px dotted blueviolet"> Here is a few my motivation factor towards online education .. </h2>
 
	        <h3 style="border: 3px solid pink">Provide professional development</h3>
		    
	        <p style="color: maroon ;">This is because effective online instruction with distinct strategies make me feel interest and motivated towards online education . For example, teacher guide discussion online with whatsapp, google classroom and google meet  make the learning session more interesting without the usual visual and auditory cues. So, I can learn just in online learning and  don't need to go to class everyday. </p>


	    <h3 style="border: 3px solid pink">Create community</h3>
	   
	   <p style="color: maroon ;">Online courses that encourage regular and effective communication among students and between teachers in my class make a better sense to us and can improve the likelihood of student success. This is because we can discuss in group whatsapp about what we don't understand in subjects any time. </p>

	   <h3 style="border: 3px solid pink">Technical factors</h3></h3>
	   
	    <p style="color: maroon ;">
		Learning via internet
		involves many other tools like video conferencing, audio and text based chat. Quality of
		technological attributes need to be very excellent so that students can do their online work smoothly without problem.Better quality of internet, proper availability of technical assistance and
		quality of online program positively influence studentsâ€™ satisfaction towards online education. To me, my internet sometimes slow that means I can't do my job smoothly and sometimes okay. </p>
